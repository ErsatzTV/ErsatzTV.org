### Add Playlist

Start by adding a playlist under `Settings` > `Playlists` > `Add playlist`.
The playlist type is `M3U Playlist` and the url is the `M3U` url from ErsatzTV (see [required urls](/docs/clients/#required-urls)).

Change the playlist name if desired, and leave `TV playlist` selected.

### Add EPG

The EPG url should be automatically detected by TiviMate, but can be manually entered as the `XMLTV` url from ErsatzTV (see [required urls](/docs/clients/#required-urls)).
