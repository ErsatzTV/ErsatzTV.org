Collections are created manually by adding individual media items to it. There is no restriction on media type. A collection can contain a single media type, eg. movies or any combination of media types.
The items to be added can be found by browsing your libraries or by using ErsatzTV's powerful [Search](/docs/search) feature. An empty collection can be created under **Lists** > **Collections** > **Add Collection**.

To create a collection, find the media items you would like to include and select them by clicking the selection button in the top left of the poster:

Then, add to a collection by clicking the **Add To Collection** button at the top of the page.

![Add Selection To Collection](/images/docs/add-selection-to-collection.png)

In the **Add To Collection** dialog, either select an existing collection for the items, or enter a new collection name to create a collection and add all of the selected items in a single step.
