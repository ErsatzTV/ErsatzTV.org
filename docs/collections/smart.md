Smart Collections are created by saving searches or saving imported Trakt Lists.

#### From Searches

To create a smart collection, type a search query in the search box and press enter.
If the result shown meets your expectations, save as a Smart Collection by clicking the `Save As` button.
If it doesn't meet your expectations, refine the search query until it does and then save.

#### From Imported Trakt Lists

To import a Trakt List, navigate to the `Lists` > `Trakt Lists` page and click the `Add Trakt List` button.  Trakt lists can be imported by url or by `user/list`.

- To re-download a Trakt List, simply add it again. There is no need to delete.
- Unmatched item details are written to the log.
- Trakt Lists can only be scheduled after being saved as a Smart Collection.

To see matching items from an imported Trakt list, click the search button on the row of the Trakt List.
