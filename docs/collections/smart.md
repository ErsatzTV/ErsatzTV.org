Smart Collections are created by saving [searches](/docs/search).

To create a smart collection, type a search query in the search box and press enter.
If the result shown meets your expectations, save as a Smart Collection by clicking the **Save As** button.
If it doesn't meet your expectations, refine the search query until it does and then save.
