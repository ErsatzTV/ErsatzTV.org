ErsatzTV does not schedule individual media items; only collections of items can be scheduled. There are three (3) collection types:

- [Collection](/docs/collections/manual): contains manually-added items
- [Smart Collection](/docs/collections/smart): contains items from search results or imported Trakt Lists, and updates dynamically
- [Multi Collection](/docs/collections/multi): contains other Collections and Smart Collections.
