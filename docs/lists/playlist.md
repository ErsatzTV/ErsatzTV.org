Playlists are an ordered list of **Collection**, **Multi Collection**, **Smart Collection**, **Television Show**, **Television Season**, **Episode**, **Artist**, **Movie**, **Music Video**, **Other Video**, **Song**, **Image** and **Remote Stream**.

Each playlist item has a few settings:

- **Playback Order** - Similar to [schedule items playback order](/docs/scheduling/classic/items#playback-order). Some playback orders are only available with certain types of content.
  - **Shuffle** - Available with all content
  - **Chronological** - Available with all content except **Multi Collections**
  - **Random** - Available with all content except **Multi Collections**
  - **Season, Episode** - Available with **Television Show**
- **Play All** - When enabled, the playlist item is "flattened" so that every media item in the collection must be played before advancing to the next playlist item.
- **Show In EPG** - When enabled, any media items scheduled from this playlist item will have an entry in the EPG.

Playlists can be added to schedules as a schedule item.
