Sequential schedules (formerly referred to as YAML schedules or YAML playouts) allow users to create sophisticated channel programming using simple YAML configuration files.

Sequential schedule definitions contain four components:

1. [Content Sources](/docs/scheduling/sequential/content) define the content (media items)
2. [Sequences](/docs/scheduling/sequential/sequence) define reusable blocks of instructions
3. [Reset Instructions](/docs/scheduling/sequential/reset) define what happens on playout reset
4. [Playout Instructions](/docs/scheduling/sequential/playout) define the programming schedule
