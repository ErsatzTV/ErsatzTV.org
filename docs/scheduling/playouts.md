Playouts assign a schedule to a channel and individually track the ordered playback of collection items.
If a schedule is used in multiple playouts (channels), the channels may not have the same content playing at the same time.

To create a Playout, navigate to the `Playouts` page and click the `Add Playout` button. Then, select the appropriate channel and schedule, and click `Add Playout` to save.
