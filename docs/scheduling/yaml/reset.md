Reset instructions are a subset of [Playout Instructions](/docs/scheduling/yaml/playout) that are allowed to be used when the playout is initially created or when the playout resets. They run once before the main playout instructions begin.

Reset instructions include:

- [skip_items](/docs/scheduling/yaml/playout#skip-items)
- [skip_to_item](/docs/scheduling/yaml/playout#skip-to-item)
- [wait_until](/docs/scheduling/yaml/playout#wait-until)
