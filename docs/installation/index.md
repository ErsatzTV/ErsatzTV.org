For all other releases, a compatible version of FFmpeg may be found at [ErsatzTV-FFmpeg](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV-ffmpeg/releases/tag/7.1.1).

### Development Builds

Development builds for all supported architectures can be found on the [develop release](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV/releases/tag/develop).
The development builds are updated with every push to the main branch and have the potential to be less stable than releases.
